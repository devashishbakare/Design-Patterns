Problem Statement
You are building an application that needs to log various events, such as user actions, errors, and status updates. The log messages should be stored consistently in a single file, and all parts of the application should access the same logger instance to avoid creating duplicate logs or multiple files.

Instructions
Create a Logger Singleton Class:
The class should have a method log(String message) that appends the message to the log file.
Use the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the Logger class is created.
Simulate Logging from Multiple Parts of the Application:
Create a couple of different classes (e.g., UserService and OrderService) that log events.
Both classes should use the same Logger instance to write messages.
Verify Singleton Behavior:
Ensure that even if UserService and OrderService try to access the logger, only one instance is used and all messages are logged to the same file.
